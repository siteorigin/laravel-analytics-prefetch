# Add Prefetching Based on Analytics Data

A simple Laravel Middleware that uses [Spatie Analytics](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-analytics) to add `rel="prefetch"` to the pages a user is most likely to visit next.  Make sure you [install](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-analytics#installation) and [configure](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-analytics#how-to-obtain-the-credentials-to-communicate-with-google-analytics) it.
